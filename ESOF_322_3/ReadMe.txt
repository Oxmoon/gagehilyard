This is a java project made with Apache NetBeans.

You have an inventory with no sorting algorithm. You are asked to chose from:
bubble, merge, insertion, quick
You can sort by entering 'sort' or exit the program on entering 'quit'

This uses the Strategy Pattern by using an interface to set the sort behavior,
and using child classes to hold the code.
