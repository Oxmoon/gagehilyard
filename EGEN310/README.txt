Fall 2021:

This folder holds my Arduino code that controls a rover constructed by my groupmates.
-----
The rover's goal is to till soil and drop seeds.
This project required a lot of electronic knowledge I did not have to begin with, it has been a long learning proccess.
-----
It is controlled by an Arduino Uno and interfaces to a HC-08 Bluetooth module that is controlled on iOS by a Pythonista script.

***UPDATE***

BTcontroller2 and Farmer3000 are the final must updated versions
