## Personal and Academic Portfolio

### Hi, my name is Gage Hilyard. I am student in Computer Science at Montana State University of Bozeman and working remotely for [Team KAIZEN Games](https://teamkaizengames.com/)!

This repository will hold my favorite coding assignments from class as well as my finished and current projects.<br>
I have some experience in Python, Java, C#, and web dev.<br>
Currently I am working on addons for **[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)** using python in my spare time to aid myself and others in language learning.
